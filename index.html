    <h2>Food Technologist | Food Safety Leader | System Builder</h2>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>With over 8 years of hands-on experience in food production, quality assurance, and food safety systems implementation, I don’t just manage processes, I transform them.</p>

      <p>Currently leading Food Safety at <strong>Greenspoon</strong>, I’m on a mission to make our private label products the gold standard in food safety and quality. By <strong>December 2025</strong>, I aim to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fully implement <strong>HACCP</strong> across all production and handling stages.</li>
        <li>Achieve <strong>KEBS standardization certification</strong> for every private label product.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My approach is anchored in vision, discipline, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I believe food safety isn’t a checkpoint, it’s a culture. And I’m building it from the ground up.</p>

      <p>Whether leading system upgrades, cross-functional audits, or staff capability-building, I bring clarity to complexity and momentum to every milestone. This site is a curated portfolio of projects I’ve led from reducing risk to optimizing quality and driving compliance across the value chain.</p>

      <p><em>Welcome to the work of someone who doesn’t wait for standards, he sets them.</em></p>
